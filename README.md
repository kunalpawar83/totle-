**_This project is a Node.js + Express Topic Retrieval API built as part of the TOTLE Backend Developer Intern – Round 1 Coding Submission._**

The API retrieves topics from a JSON file and provides:

Search functionality (case-insensitive)

Optional sorting by topic name

Proper error handling and input validation

Clean MVC folder architecture

**For now, the project reads topics from a local JSON file. In future, this can be replaced with a database or dynamic data storage.**
